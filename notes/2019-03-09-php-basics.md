PHP Basics

## PHP Installation (Mac OS X)
There are various ways to install PHP on a Mac. PHP is already installed on my Mac, but if I need to install it in the future, simply install Homebrew, search for PHP and install the latest version. After installation, I can use 'php -v' to check the installed version of PHP. 

If I don't want to use Homebrew, I can use MAMP instead. MAMP gives you every thing you need to get up and running very quickly(Apache + MySQL, PHP).

# Start a server
To start a server on Terminal, 'cd' into the directory the PHP file is in, and type in 'php -S localhost:8888'.
# PHP files
End with .php extension
